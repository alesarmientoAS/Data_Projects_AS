# Data_Projects_AS
This repository contains learning projects &amp; self interest initiatives.

This is the first approach to understand the importance of Git, the chance to create a Github repository and most important to start practicing with data, Pandas and other dataframes, Jupyterlab Notebooks, markdown language & even html.

**The value of this first repository lies in the fact that IÂ´ve been a Big Data Student for less than 3 months, no tech background, just eager to work proactively in data projects and be a catalyst for new data based business solutions**
